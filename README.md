🏥 Python Health Projects
Moving from a Pre-Medical background to Computer Science, I built these projects to bridge the gap between healthcare and technology. This repository tracks my journey in learning Python, Data Structures, and Data Science.

🚀 Projects Included
BMI Calculator: A tool that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) and provides instant health status (Underweight, Normal, Overweight).
Patient Tracker: A system to manage multiple patient records using Python Lists and Dictionaries.
Data Persistence (JSON): Integrated the JSON module to save and load patient data permanently in .json files.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.13
Data Format: JSON (for data storage)
Tools: VS Code, Git, and GitHub
Concepts: Dictionaries, File Handling, and Serialization

📈 My Progress
Currently in my 1st Semester (BSCS), exploring how data science can revolutionize medical records.
