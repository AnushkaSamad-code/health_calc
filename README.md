🏥 Python Health Projects
Moving from a Pre-Medical background to Computer Science, I built these projects to bridge the gap between healthcare and technology. This repository tracks my journey in learning Python, Data Structures, and Data Science.

🚀 Projects Included
BMI Calculator: A tool that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) and provides instant health status (Underweight, Normal, Overweight).
Patient Tracker: A system to manage multiple patient records using Python Lists and Dictionaries.
Data Persistence (JSON): Integrated the JSON module to save and load patient data permanently in .json files.
OOP Implementation: Applied Object-Oriented Programming concepts by creating a Student class with custom methods to manage student data more efficiently.
Advanced OOP Concepts: Implemented Inheritance using the super() function to create a scalable system where a Patient class inherits core attributes from a Person base class, optimizing code reuse
Multiple Inheritance: Designed a complex structure where a medicalintern class simultaneously inherits specialized attributes from both student and hospitalworker classes, showcasing data integration from multiple parent sources.
Multilevel Inheritance: Established a multi-generational class hierarchy (Person → MedicalStaff → Doctor) to demonstrate deep attribute propagation and complex object initialization using the super() method.
Hybrid Inheritance: A sophisticated mix of Hierarchical and Multiple inheritance. Created a MedicalScientist class that integrates clinical data from Doctor and research data from Researcher, resolving the complex "diamond problem" structure.
Method Resolution Order (MRO): Explored Python's internal logic for method priority in Multiple Inheritance scenarios. Implemented examples to demonstrate how Python resolves naming conflicts by searching classes in a specific "Left-to-Right" order.
Method Overriding (Polymorphism): Implemented logic to redefine parent class methods in child classes, allowing for specialized behavior and updated functionality.
Implemented data security by using private attributes (with __) to lock sensitive information. Created public "Getter" methods to allow controlled, read-only access to internal data without exposing it directly.

📈 My Progress
Currently in my 2nd Semester (BSCS), exploring how data science can revolutionize medical records.
